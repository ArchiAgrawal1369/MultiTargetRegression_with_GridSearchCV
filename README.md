# MultiTargetRegression_with_GridSearchCV
Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV for Multi Target Regression Prediction

The dataset contains information on monthly sales for different products with different features. It is important to note that there are multiple dependent/target variables that need to be predicted.

Preprocess the data, perform Exploratory analysis and train the model using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning for various regression models like Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor. 

Conclusion: Linear Regression gave the most accurate results.
